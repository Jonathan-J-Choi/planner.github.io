Welcome to Karen!
Your personal daily planner.

Karen gives you the time and date, updating every second.
Your tasks are organized by hour and color: red tasks represent the current task, grey the past tasks, and green the future tasks.
You can save your memos and they will stay there even when you refresh the page.
When you are done with your tasks of the day you can tell Karen to clear your schedule, clearing all of your tasks and refreshing the page.
